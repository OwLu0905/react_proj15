# React project 2 -- fetch data challenge
## use the skill
* async function
* await 
* fetch
> ## not adapted but need to familiar with
> * try / catch / finally
> * useEffect
> * useRef

## Content
* Use `async` function to `fetch` data.
* The `await` operator knowledge (only used inside an async function).
* Once we click the buttons, we will fetch the url of buttons to get the data.
* From the data (JSON type), we show the child of data to the list.

## Something to be improved
* the `fetch` operator with different **CRUD method** 
* JSON data structure. (ex: json.length, how to get the key/value)
